# Azure Subscription Cleanup Scripts - Resource Level
<sup>Created by Dan Grecoe, a Microsoft employee</sup>

It can be very useful to an administrator to understand all of the resources that are contained within a subscription. 

This high level view gives a broad understanding of what is contained in the subscription and could be used to determine where the bigger costs are being accrued. 

The scripts in this repository can be used to clean identify resources, but not delete them.

While the scripts below do not directly delete resources, they can be modified quite easily to call [Remove-AzureRMResource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/remove-azurermresource?view=azurermps-6.13.0), which will delete individual resources from the subscription.

## Identify all resources
Having a list of all resources in a subscription can be useful in that it gives a broad picture of consumption in a subscription. 

This script is used to generate a list of all resources, broken out by Azure Region, contained in a subscription.

## Identify all resources script

|File|Description|
|--------------------|------------------------|              
| ListResources.ps1|	This scirpt is used to collect a list of all resources in the subscription organized by region. The results simply provide a count of each type of resource found. The results are printed out to a file.|


### Script Parameters
|Parameter |Required|Usage|
|--------------------|---------|-----------------------|
|-subId "id"| Yes|	The subscripiton ID to use for finding resource groups to delete.| 
|-login| No| A flag, when present means user should be logged in, otherwise assumes user is logged in.|
|-help|	No| A flag indicating to show the usage of the script. Nothing will be performed.|

### Script Output
This script will output a text file in the script directory named [subid]_resources.json.

## Identify resources by type and optionally delete them
Instead of a list of all resources, it is sometimes useful to find all resources of a certain type such as storage accounts. 

This script is used to generate a list of all resources of a specific type, broken out by Azure Region, contained in a subscription.

>NOTE If deletion is chosen the resource group and/or the resource can have no locks associated with it. This follows the same rules as trying to delete a resource group. 

## Identify resources by type script
|File|Description|
|--------------------|------------------------|

|-resourceType "type"| Yes| The type of resource type to find. Example: Microsoft.BatchAI/jobs|
|-resourceGroup "groupname"| No| If provided it, the search will only look for resources of type resourceType in the specified resourceGroup|
